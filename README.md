# ffmpeg-normalize

The goal is to keep this image as minimal-possible to ffmpeg-normalize and upto-date with its releases


Initial work will be to produce a working image based off of "whatever the latest is"

afterwards I hope to configure this to automatically follow ffmpeg-normalize and build each one of its published tags
